# Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a failover controller that will control which scheduler is up and running to allow HA across an Airflow cluster. 


## Motivation 

We had attempted to setup a Highly Available Airflow Cluster where we had 2 machines with all the normal Airflow Daemons (web server, scheduler, workers, etc.) running on them. Each of the instances would share a MySQL instances as its MetaStore and share a RabbitMQ Queue for its Queueing Services (since we were using CeleryExecutors).
 
What we noticed after a month running the Cluster is that the schedulers would occasionally push a duplicate task instance to the RabbitMQ Queue. Therefore the Airflow executors would execute the same task instance twice. This caused a lot of data inconsistency issues.

This is what motivated us to search for an alternative to our initial approach to build a highly available Airflow Cluster. It lead to us creating this module.


## How it Works

The Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller (ASFC) is a mechanism that ensures that only one Scheduler instance is running in an Airflow Cluster at a time. This way you don't come across the issues we described in the "Motivation" section above.

You will first need to startup the ASFC on each of the instances you want the scheduler to be running on. When you start up multiple instances of the ASFC one of them takes on the Active state and the other takes on a Standby state. There is a heart beat mechanism setup to track if the Active ASFC is still active. If the Active ASFC misses multiple heart beats, the Standby ASFC becomes active.

The Active ASFC will poll every 10 seconds to see if the scheduler is running on the desired node. If it is not, the ASFC will try to restart the daemon. If the scheduler daemons still doesn't startup, the daemon is started on another node in the cluster.

## Startup/Status/Shutdown Instructions

### Quickstart

#### Startup

##### Startup in the foreground

    scheduler_failover_controller start

##### Startup as a background process

    nohup scheduler_failover_controller start > /dev/null &

#### Status

    ps -eaf | grep scheduler_failover_controller

#### Shutdown
 
    for pid in `ps -ef | grep "scheduler_failover_controller" | awk '{print $2}'` ; do kill -9 $pid ; done

### Systemd

The Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller also allows you to control the process with systemd. The systemd files can be found under ${PROJECT_HOME}/scripts/systemd. Within this directory is a README.md file which describes how to deploy the systemd files. Bellow illustrates how to run the process after deploying the files.

Note: **Run as Root**

#### Startup

    sudo systemctl start scheduler_failover_controller
    
#### Status

    sudo systemctl status scheduler_failover_controller

#### Shutdown

    sudo systemctl stop scheduler_failover_controller
    
#### Restart

    sudo systemctl restart scheduler_failover_controller

## Getting Started

This is a step by step set of instructions you can take to get up and running with the scheduler_failover_controller

1. Install the ASFC on all the desired machines

    * See the above section entitled "Installation"
    
2. Run the following CLI command to get the default configurations setup in airflow.cfg
 
        scheduler_failover_controller init

##### PS: Virtualenv support
You can use the scheduler_failover_controller on a virtual environment too. To do so, you need to specify the activation path of your virtual environment:

        scheduler_failover_controller -venv PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV/bin/activate init

        
3. Update the default configurations that were added to the bottom of the airflow.cfg file under the [scheduler_failover] section

    a. Main ones include updating: **scheduler_nodes_in_cluster**, **alert_to_email**
    
       * For scheduler_nodes_in_cluster property, it is recommended that you use the value printed from the following command:
       
        scheduler_failover_controller get_current_host
        
       * So, if this command printed out 'ip-10-0-0-98', include this as the value for that particular host. 
    
4. Enable all the machines to be able to ssh to each of the other machines with the user you're running airflow as
    
    a. Create a public and private key SSH key on all of the machines you want to act as schedulers. You can follow these instructions: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2
        
    b. Add the public key content to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on all the other machines

5. Run the following CLI command to test the connection to all the machines that will act as Schedulers

        scheduler_failover_controller test_connection

6. Startup the following Airflow Daemons

    a. webserver
    
        nohup airflow webserver $* >> ~/airflow/logs/webserver.logs &
    
    b. workers (If you're using the CeleryExecutor)

        nohup airflow worker $* >> ~/airflow/logs/celery.logs &

7. Startup the Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller on each node you would like acting as the Scheduler Failover Controller (ONE AT A TIME).

    * See the above section entitled "Startup/Status/Shutdown Instructions"
    
8. View the logs to ensure things are running correctly

    * Location of the logs can be determined by the 'logging_dir' configuration entry in the airflow.cfg 
    
    * Note: Logs are set by default to rotate at midnight and only keep 7 days worth of backups. This can be overridden in the configuration file.
    
9. View the metadata to ensure things are being set correctly

        scheduler_failover_controller metadata


## Recommended Steps for a Better Deployment

Above describes a quickstart approach. However, if you're looking for a better long term approach for using the Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller then you can follow the bellow steps.

### Setup Systemd for Airflow

Airflow provides scripts to help you control the airflow daemons through the **systemctl** command. It is recommended that you setup the airflow-scheduler, at least, for systemd. 
  
Go to https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/tree/master/scripts/systemd and follow the instructions in the README file to get it setup.

### Update airflow.cfg configs to use the Systemd

    airflow_scheduler_start_command = sudo systemctl restart airflow-scheduler
    
    airflow_scheduler_stop_command = sudo systemctl stop airflow-scheduler
    
### Setup the Airflow Scheduler Failover Controller to use Systemd

Follow the instructions in ${PROJECT_HOME}/scripts/systemd/README.md to set it up.
